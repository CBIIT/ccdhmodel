The \"id\" field is more likely to be a serially or randomly generated value that is assigned to the data object as it is created in a system. method_type - A type of method used in generating the Observation result. observation_type - The specific type of tobacco exposure observation made - i.e. the feature or characteristic that was observed, measured, estimated, etc.. performed_by - The organization or group that performed the observation activity. subject - The patient that the observation is about (if not the direct focus). e.g. observations are often made on specimens derived from a patient, or other entities related to a patient, that ultimately tell us something about the patient of interest. value_codeable_concept - The result of the observation, encoded as a CodeableConcept. value_integer - The result of the observation, encoded as an integer. concurrent_treatment - Treatment instance(s) that are concurrent with this treatment. date_ended - The timepoint at which the treatment ended. date_started - The timepoint at which the treatment started. id - The 'logical' identifier of the entity within the system of record. The simple value of this attribute stands for an identifier of this data object within the system, it can be used as a reference from other objects within the same system (i.e. primary and foreign keys), and it should be unique per type of object.

Business identifiers are assigned outside the information system and are captured in the \"identifier\" field.

Also, since these identifiers are created outside the information system through a specific business process, the Identifier type has additional attributes to capture this additional metadata so the actual identifier values are qualified by the context that created those values. This additional context allows \"identifier\" instances to be transmitted as business data across systems while still being able to trace them back to the system of origin. number_of_cycles - The number of treatment cycles the subject received. regimen - The regimen or line of therapy subject - The subject (person, animal, model system) to which the treatment was administered. therapeutic_agent - One or more therapeutic agents that are administered as part of this treatment. treatment_anatomic_site - The anatomical site that the treatment targets. treatment_effect - The effect of a treatment on the diagnosis or tumor. treatment_end_reason - The reason the treatment ended. treatment_for_diagnosis - The diagnosis for which this treatment is intended. treatment_frequency - The frequency of using the substance described by this instance. treatment_intent - The medical intent of the treatment. treatment_outcome - The final outcome of the treatment. treatment_type - The type of treatment administered, which may include medication/therapeutics or other procedures.","title":"Slots"},{"location":"#enums","text":"enum_CRDCH_AlcoholExposureObservation_category - Autogenerated Enumeration for CRDC-H AlcoholExposureObservation category enum_CRDCH_AlcoholExposureObservation_method_type - Autogenerated Enumeration for CRDC-H AlcoholExposureObservation method_type enum_CRDCH_AlcoholExposureObservation_observation_type - Types of observations about a Subject's exposure to alcohol. enum_CRDCH_AlcoholExposureObservation_value_codeable_concept - Autogenerated Enumeration for CRDC-H AlcoholExposureObservation value_codeable_concept enum_CRDCH_BiologicProduct_product_type - Autogenerated Enumeration for CRDC-H BiologicProduct product_type enum_CRDCH_BodySite_qualifier - Autogenerated Enumeration for CRDC-H BodySite qualifier enum_CRDCH_BodySite_site - Autogenerated Enumeration for CRDC-H BodySite site enum_CRDCH_CancerGradeObservationSet_category - Autogenerated Enumeration for CRDC-H CancerGradeObservationSet category enum_CRDCH_CancerGradeObservationSet_method_type - A morphologic classification system of malignant tumors, usually relating to disease progression and clinical outcome.

As the model evolves, classes may be added or removed from the model, attributes may be added or removed from classes, and the allowed values for particular attributes may change, either relating to other classes in the model or to terminology-bound enumerations. Approach The CRDC-H model is released as a LinkML document . Using LinkML provides us with a number of automatically generated computable artifacts which directly correspond to the model, allowing us to apply the model in a number of ways, including the following: JSON schema : validate that a JSON document uses fields and values which are valid according to the model. ShEx schema : validate that an RDF dataset uses predicates and values which are valid according to the model. GraphQL schema : express a GraphQL application programming interface corresponding to the LinkML model. OWL ontology : Description Logic representation of the model. RDF dataset : RDF representation of the model which is easily integrated into a broader triplestore. Python API : a representation of the model as Python classes and methods. The last artifact, the Python API, is the currently preferred approach for creating transformations from other data formats and schemas into CRDC-H. Using the API directly to construct data objects helps to ensure that the resulting structure will be conformant with the model. We are implementing demonstration use cases in this repository: https://github.com/cancerDHC/example-data Migrating data Because each version of the CRDC-H LinkML model will have a corresponding Python implementation, we envision data migration as consisting of instantiating the Python objects of the newer API from those in the previous API. Ideally, we will provide a Python migration script with each model release, which takes as input a model in the previous model version. Migrations from earlier model versions can be performed as a series of single-version migrations. Migration scripts will need to be aware of which changes are \u201csafe\u201d, vs. which involve possible data loss (e.g., a field has been removed from a class and there is no replacement). Any such operations should be clearly reported in a migration log, particularly when no satisfactory migration could be performed for a data element. Generalizing migration operations Since the LinkML infrastructure already provides us with a framework for programmatically interacting with the CRDC-H model, any generalizable issues we need to address in development of migration scripts should be incorporated into LinkML as a framework feature. Any support for these operations that could be incorporated into LinkML itself would help to make the model-specific migration implementations more declarative and more maintainable. As an example, LinkML could provide a standardized means for mapping between successive editions of an enumeration (perhaps it has been decided to use label-based enum values rather than CURIEs), such that it is only required to provide the mapping rather than implement a custom transformation.","title":"Data Migration"},{"location":"data-migration/#migrating-data-between-crdc-h-model-versions","text":"As the CRDC-H model evolves with each release, data conforming to one edition of the model will require migration in order to conform to newer editions of the model.
