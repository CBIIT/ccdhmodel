# Custom generators

This directory contains some generators that are specific to
the CRDC-H model. This includes:

- markdowngen.py: Python script to generate the Markdown documentation.
  This is from the [`ccdh-dev` branch of the LinkML fork]. You can compare
  it to the actual [markdowngen.py] file in LinkML.
