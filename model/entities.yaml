title: CDM Data Type Object References
description: >-
  This sheet holds descriptions of objects referenced as the Data Type of a field in the Biospecimen CDM, and likely to
  be represented as Entities/Classes/Resources in our final model, but which are out of scope to fully define in the
  current phase of work. We will record these candidate Entities/Classes/Resources here, and document their proposed
  use and requirements to support Biospecimen representation. Requiremetns accrued as we model additional subdomains
  will inform if and how these entties are represented in our model.
