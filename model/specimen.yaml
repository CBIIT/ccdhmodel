description: >-
  Any material sample taken from a biological entity (living or dead), or taken from a physical object or the
  environment. (Adapted from FHIR) Specimens are usually collected as an example of their kind, often for use in some
  investigation.
comments:
  - In our first pass we are defining a single 'Specimen' type to cover ADM Sample, Portion, Aliquot, Analyte, and Slide.
  - The enum/value set for the 'type' field will include terms to distinguish between these types of specimens, e.g. 'original', 'portion', 'pool', 'analyte', 'aliquot', 'slide'.
  - ADM properties across these source entities will be aggregated and merged into this single CDM Specimen entity.
