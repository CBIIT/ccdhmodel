title: TCCM URI Prefixes
description: >-
  Any material sample taken from a biological entity (living or dead), or taken from a physical object or the
  environment. (Adapted from FHIR) Specimens are usually collected as an example of their kind, often for use in some
  investigation.
comments:
  - In our first pass we are defining a single 'Specimen' type to cover ADM Sample, Portion, Aliquot, Analyte, and Slide.
  - The enum/value set for the 'type' field will include terms to distinguish between these types of specimens, e.g. 'original', 'portion', 'pool', 'analyte', 'aliquot', 'slide'.
  - ADM properties across these source entities will be aggregated and merged into this single CDM Specimen entity.

      id:
        description: >-
          The 'logical' identifier of the entity in the system of record, e.g. a UUID.  This 'id' is unique within a
          given system. The identified entity may have a different 'id' in a different system.
        comments:
          - >-
              We use  FHIR naming conventions here, where 'id' is used for the logical identifier, and 'identifier'
              for the business identifier.
        notes:
          - The spreadsheet makes this optional, but some sort of identifier is required

      identifier:

          A 'business' identifier  or accession number for the entity, typically as provided by an external system or

            MHB - Thoughts on whether I accurately summarized the relevant aspects of FHIR identifier fields/data
            types, and whether it is prudent for us to propose adopting these at this point?  Happy to take a
            different direction if others feel strongly, or consider alternate names for these attributes
            (e.g. 'internal_id' vs  'external_id')
          - ->
            BTF - well, i find 'id' and 'identifier' difficult to distinguish without knowing the FHIR definitions
            of these.  certainly 'internal_id' or 'logical_id' and 'external_id' or 'business_id' make a clearer
            distinction between the meaning of these fields.  that said, i am fine sticking with FHIR-aligned
            attributes here unless others object
          - ->
            SE - the "id" is really implementation dependent thing. In REST/FHIR it's the resoruce identifier,
            in Java there is no such thing since it's a memory location, etc.  So, if it's adds confusion just
            leave it out and focus on the business "identifier" modeling
          - ->
            DJ - Need to find a way to represent the conditional mapping to FHIR identifier
