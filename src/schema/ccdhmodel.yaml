          degrees of severity. Histopathologic grade of a tumor may be used to plan
          treatment and estimate the future course, outcome, and overall prognosis
          of disease. Certain types of cancers, such as soft tissue sarcoma, primary
          brain tumors, lymphomas, and breast have special grading systems.
