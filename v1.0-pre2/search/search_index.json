The simple value of this attribute stands for an identifier of this data object within the system, it can be used as a reference from other objects within the same system (i.e. primary and foreign keys), and it should be unique per type of object. The same data object copied to a different system will likely have a different \"id\" in the new system since \"id\" values are system specific and do not represent persistent business identifiers. Business identifiers are assigned outside the information system and are captured in the \"identifier\" field. The \"id\" field is more likely to be a serially or randomly generated value that is assigned to the data object as it is created in a system. range: CcdhString identifier 0..* Description: A 'business' identifier or accession number for the entity, typically as provided by an external system or authority, that are globally unique and persist across implementing systems. Also, since these identifiers are created outside the information system through a specific business process, the Identifier type has additional attributes to capture this additional metadata so the actual identifier values are qualified by the context that created those values. This additional context allows \"identifier\" instances to be transmitted as business data across systems while still being able to trace them back to the system of origin. range: Identifier species 0..1 Description: The scientific binomial name for the species of the subject (e.g. Homo sapiens, Mus musculus, etc.) range: enum_CCDH_Subject_species Examples: Homo sapiens, Canis familiaris, Mus musculus breed 0..1 Description: A label given to a group of animals homogeneous in appearance and other characteristics that distinguish it from other animals of the same species. range: enum_CCDH_Subject_breed Examples: Affenpinscher, Afghan Hound, Airedale Terrier, Akita sex 0..1 Description: The biologic character or quality that distinguishes male and female from one another as expressed by analysis of the person's gonadal, morphologic (internal and external), chromosomal, and hormonal characteristics. range: enum_CCDH_Subject_sex Examples: Female, Intersex, Male, Not Reported, Unknown, Unspecified ethnicity 0..1 Description: An individual's self-described social and cultural grouping, specifically whether an individual describes themselves as Hispanic or Latino.

As the model evolves, classes may be added or removed from the model, attributes may be added or removed from classes, and the allowed values for particular attributes may change, either relating to other classes in the model or to terminology-bound enumerations. Approach The CRDC-H model is released as a LinkML document . Using LinkML provides us with a number of automatically generated computable artifacts which directly correspond to the model, allowing us to apply the model in a number of ways, including the following: JSON schema : validate that a JSON document uses fields and values which are valid according to the model. ShEx schema : validate that an RDF dataset uses predicates and values which are valid according to the model. GraphQL schema : express a GraphQL application programming interface corresponding to the LinkML model. OWL ontology : Description Logic representation of the model. RDF dataset : RDF representation of the model which is easily integrated into a broader triplestore. Python API : a representation of the model as Python classes and methods. The last artifact, the Python API, is the currently preferred approach for creating transformations from other data formats and schemas into CRDC-H. Using the API directly to construct data objects helps to ensure that the resulting structure will be conformant with the model. We are implementing demonstration use cases in this repository: https://github.com/cancerDHC/example-data Migrating data Because each version of the CRDC-H LinkML model will have a corresponding Python implementation, we envision data migration as consisting of instantiating the Python objects of the newer API from those in the previous API. Ideally, we will provide a Python migration script with each model release, which takes as input a model in the previous model version. Migrations from earlier model versions can be performed as a series of single-version migrations. Migration scripts will need to be aware of which changes are \u201csafe\u201d, vs. which involve possible data loss (e.g., a field has been removed from a class and there is no replacement). Any such operations should be clearly reported in a migration log, particularly when no satisfactory migration could be performed for a data element. Generalizing migration operations Since the LinkML infrastructure already provides us with a framework for programmatically interacting with the CRDC-H model, any generalizable issues we need to address in development of migration scripts should be incorporated into LinkML as a framework feature. Any support for these operations that could be incorporated into LinkML itself would help to make the model-specific migration implementations more declarative and more maintainable. As an example, LinkML could provide a standardized means for mapping between successive editions of an enumeration (perhaps it has been decided to use label-based enum values rather than CURIEs), such that it is only required to provide the mapping rather than implement a custom transformation.","title":"Data Migration"},{"location":"data-migration/#migrating-data-between-crdc-h-model-versions","text":"As the CRDC-H model evolves with each release, data conforming to one edition of the model will require migration in order to conform to newer editions of the model.
