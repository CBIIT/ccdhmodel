<li><a href="CodeableConcept/">CodeableConcept</a> - A representation of a concept that may be defined by or mapped to one or more codes in code systems (terminologies, ontologies, dictionaries, code sets, etc) - but may also be defined by the provision of text.</li>
<li><a href="Coding/">Coding</a> - A structured representation of a coded/enumerated data value, that includes additional metadata about the code and code system.</li>
<li><a href="Diagnosis/">Diagnosis</a> - A collection of characteristics that describe an abnormal condition of the body as assessed at a point in time. May be used to capture information about neoplastic and non-neoplastic conditions.</li>
<li><a href="DimensionalObservation/">DimensionalObservation</a> - A structured object that describes a single data item about the physical dimensions  of an entity (e.g. length width, area), as generated through a point-in-time observation or measurement.</li>

<li><a href="Document/">Document</a> - A collection of information intented to be understood together as a whole, and codified in human-readable form.</li>
<li><a href="EnvironmentalExposureObservation/">EnvironmentalExposureObservation</a> - A structured object that describes a single data item about an individual's exposure to an environmental factor, as generated through a point-in-time observation, measurement, or interpretation.</li>
<li><a href="ExecutionConditionObservation/">ExecutionConditionObservation</a> - A structured object that describes how long certain parts on an activity took to complete, as determined through a point-in-time observation or measurement.</li>
<li><a href="ExecutionTimeObservation/">ExecutionTimeObservation</a> - A structured object that describes how long certain parts on an activity took to complete, as determined through a point-in-time observation or measurement.</li>
<li><a href="Exposure/">Exposure</a> - Contact between an agent and a target. A state of contact or close proximity to a medicinal product, chemical, pathogen, radioisotope or other substance.</li>
<li><a href="HistologicalCompositionObservation/">HistologicalCompositionObservation</a> - An observation about characteristics of a specimen at a microscopic level - typically related to its cellular or tissue composition. (e.g. how many cells in the specimen are of a given type, or exhibit a particular cellular phenotype).</li>
<li><a href="HistologicalCompositionObservationSet/">HistologicalCompositionObservationSet</a> - A set of one or more discrete observations that quantify the relative or absolute composition of a specimen at cellular level - e.g. how many cells in the specimen are of a given type, or exhibit a particular cellular phenotype.</li>
<li><a href="Identifier/">Identifier</a> - An Identifier is associated with a unique object or entity within a given system.</li>
<li><a href="Observation/">Observation</a> - A structured object that describes a single data item about an entity, as generated through a point-in-time observation, measurement, or interpretation.</li>

<li><a href="specimen__id/">id</a> - The 'logical' identifier of the entity within the system of record.  The simple value of this attribute stands for an identifier of this data object within the system, it can be used as a reference from other objects within the same system (i.e. primary and foreign keys), and it should be unique per type of object. The same data object copied to a different system will likely have a different "id" in the new system since "id" values are system specific and do not represent persistent business identifiers. Business identifiers are assigned outside the information system and are captured in the "identifier" field. The "id" field is more likely to be a serially or randomly generated value that is assigned to the data object as it is created in a system.</li>
